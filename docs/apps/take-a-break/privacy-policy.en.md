# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Take a Break is a macOS menu bar application designed to remind you to rest regularly and balance work and life. We understand that privacy and data security are crucial to you. Therefore, we explain how we handle and protect your information.

## Core Principles

- We only collect information necessary to maintain app functionality.
- Unless otherwise stated, we do not transmit your data to our servers or third parties.
- You can reset or delete locally stored data at any time.

## Information We Collect

The app stores the following types of data locally on your device, and this data never leaves your device:

- **Preferences**: Including work/rest duration, theme, language, whether to display countdown in the menu bar, etc.
- **Trial Status**: Records trial start time, unlock status, etc., to protect your trial and subscription benefits.
- **Locally Imported Content**: Such as custom work/rest images and text lists, all stored on your local disk.

We do not proactively collect personally identifiable information such as names, contact details, or geographic location.

## Purchase & Transaction Information

Take a Break completes trials, subscriptions, and in-app purchases through Apple's StoreKit and App Store infrastructure. Authentication, payment information, and receipts during the purchase process are handled by Apple, and we cannot access your complete payment information. We only receive transaction results from StoreKit (such as whether unlock was successful) to update your subscription status.

## Data Use Purpose

- Save and synchronize app preferences to provide personalized experience.
- Determine whether your trial is still valid and whether your subscription has been unlocked.
- Verify authorization status during purchase restoration to ensure you can continue using paid features.

## Third-Party Services

Currently, we only use Apple's StoreKit and App Store services to handle purchases and subscriptions. If we integrate new third-party services in the future, we will clarify their purpose and scope in an updated privacy policy.

## Data Retention & Security

All preference data is stored on your device (such as in `UserDefaults` or the app sandbox directory). We do not remotely sync or back up this data. Please keep your macOS system updated and manage your device properly to prevent unauthorized access.

## Your Rights

- **Access & Export**: You can view current preferences in the app settings. To export, you can manually back up configuration files.
- **Correction & Deletion**: Changing settings immediately overwrites old data. Uninstalling the app or manually deleting configuration files removes all local data.
- **Withdraw Consent**: You can stop using the app or disable related features (such as notifications, sounds, image display, etc.) at any time.

## Policy Updates

We may update our privacy policy based on feature iterations or regulatory requirements. Important changes will be highlighted in the app or on the project homepage. If you continue using Take a Break after a policy update, it means you accept the updated content.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about this policy, you can email us at [tackabreak@quteam.com](mailto:tackabreak@quteam.com) or submit a question below this page. We will respond as soon as possible.
